# WELCOME TO GIT

- I'm adding this from feature-branch
- This is coming from 'dev-komut'

# Typical workflow
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a new branch from the main or another branch
3. Make your changes
4. Push the branch to the remote repo
5. Open a pull request
6. Merge the changes
7. Pull the merged changes into your local main branch
8. Repeat from step 2
